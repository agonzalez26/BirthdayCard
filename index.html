<!--Write a birthday card to a friend or family member using HTML and CSS. Use HTML to define the content
of the card (like the headings and the paragraphs), and use CSS to define the appearance. Some ideas:
Make the background-color of the page baby blue and use purple ink to write a card to a little boy
Make the text big and include pictures of hearts
Use a font with text shadows (more advanced)
Use this opportunity to experiment with the plethora of CSS properties.
Remember that you're in a computer science class (not an art class), so we don't care if your card looks ugly.
The main thing is that you learn HTML and CSS and use them appropriately-->
